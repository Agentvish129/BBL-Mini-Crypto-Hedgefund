Crypto data access
We could use several databases:
We need 1-2 students to take partial code from “coin-market-cap-data-engineering-project” on Github to update our daily data for the past 12 months
Further discussion in team meeting with Prof. Jiang
The crypto trading data from CoinMarketCap before May 2024 will be included in the shared folder. 
We can consider other databases after testing some initial strategies
